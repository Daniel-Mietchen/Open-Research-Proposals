This GitHub repository serves the collaborative drafting of a project proposal on an Encyclopaedia of (and GitHub for) science, 
as explained at https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/Open-Research-Proposals . 

The .tex file was started by pasting below the leftovers from the 
\href{http://species-id.net/w/index.php?title=Draft:Encyclopaedia_of_original_research&oldid=5524}{drafting of the above blog post} . 

We then turned this into LaTeX format and plan to continue drafting that way~-- please excuse any strange formatting you may see in here until late May 20, 2011.

Comments and suggestions *very* welcome.
