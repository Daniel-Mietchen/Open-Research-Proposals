This GitHub repository serves the collaborative drafting of a project proposal on an Encyclopaedia of (and GitHub for) science, 
as explained at http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Open_grant_writing_-_Encyclopaedia_of_original_research . 

The proposal is being developed in LaTeX format, so that we don't have to deal with formatting when submission time comes.

Comments and suggestions *very* welcome.
