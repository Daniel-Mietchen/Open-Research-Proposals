This GitHub repository serves the collaborative drafting of a project proposal on an Encyclopaedia of (and GitHub for) science, 
as explained at https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/Open-Research-Proposals . 

We then turned this into LaTeX format, so that we don't have to deal with formatting when submission time comes.

Comments and suggestions *very* welcome.
