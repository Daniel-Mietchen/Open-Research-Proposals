		{\bf The real abstract, or at least some potential phrasing for it}:
		One of the basic rights of society is universal access to knowledge. For information to be transformed into knowledge it needs to be accurate, up-to-date and freely available. Scientific knowledge is at the core of social and community development, but access to up-to date information is limited for those outside of narrow academic circles. These limitations are the result of licencing terms and formats that are typical of the traditional scientific publication system.
Traditional publications do not reflect (nor have they room for) the continued updating and revising of the published material. This slows down the progress of science, since it contradicts its nature of having ideas and results under constant revision and interpretations being in need to adapt to new findings.
We want to place the existing openly licensed scientific literature where it can become dynamic and where it can facilitate public discussion and outreach. We want these formats to be compatible with the needs to: 1) record science as it happens, 2) review how it happened 3) review the interpretation of the results 4) identify gaps in knowledge, infrastructure or methodology, and 5) stimulate further research.

\section{Introduction}
Scientific research consists of collaboratively exploring and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge through well-documented and contextualized sets of observations. The newly acquired knowledge is shared with the scientific and wider community through published reports, usually in scientific periodicals. In most areas of science, these reports take the form of 'complete stories' that describe a series of experiments that contribute a relatively complete picture of the new findings by reporting on sets of experiments that complement each other. One consequence of this mode of reporting is that the data that is being generated (and the knowledge that can be derived from them) are not made known until the entire set of experiments are completed. In some instances, the process of producing a 'complete' paper can take years.
There are several consequences of this ubiquitous practice:
\begin{enumerate}
\item while science knowledge within a research group grows in small continuous incremental steps, the community outside the research group does not gain access to that knowledge until the process is completed. 
\item unaware of the existance of those intermediate steps, research groups end up duplicating work in parallel. 
\item data that is generated that may not be justifiably included in a scientific report (because it does not contribute to the overall 'story') does not get published and remains unknown to the wider community. 
\item the costs of this orphaned data are burdened upon the funding agencies, and indirectly, upon taxpayers. 
\item the narrative of scientific publications (especially as they continue to increase in number) becomes highly redundant layering unnecessary burdens on the scientists' time occupied with 're-writing' text for publications, that in themselves, do not constitute new knowledge. 
\item The delays imposed by the proces of traditional publication (writing, peer review, revisions, copy editing) further delay the availability of the work from its completion to the published state. 
\item Once published, further modifications to the work that may be suitable due to new results cannot be incorporated into the existing work without going through an new cycle of publication. 
\end{enumerate}

As a result research publishing can be best viewed as the business of providing low-resolution snapshots of these
steadily evolving processes. In themselves, scientific publications are poor containers of knowledge because they do not provide sufficient granularity to fully describe the process of the acquisition of knowledge, nor do they allow contributions to the original work that may enhance the interpretation of the data. 

The prevailing structure of scientific publishing has seen few changes since its origins in the mid-17th century. With limitations of supporting technology for communication, time to travel between different parts of the globe, etc, scientific publishers provided an efficient solution to scientific communication through the printed work. The last century has seen a revolution in communication and transport that are, however, more efficient for communication between scientists, and the role of the printed article as the sole source of information can therefore be brought into question. In addition, the number of articles published per year has significantly increased in the last century, partly due to the increase in number of groups dedicated to scientific research and the accelerated pace at which data can be acquired due to the technological and computational technology. While new technology has accelerated the generation of data, new technology to accelerate the communication of these results has not been widely (or efficiently) adopted. 

The 21st century sees a rise in the number of researchers that reflect upon whether science is best served by continuing with the traditional practices, and consider alternatives that retain the value of the process of scientific communication and peer review but that also take advantage of the technology that has the potential of accelerating (and enhancing) the way in which scientists communicate their results. 

We propose that scientific information can be more efficiently exploited if it were to be placed in formats that take advantage of the features that are offered by collaborative online platforms. Specifically, we want to explore the potential of openly licensed scientific information to provide a basis for systematic reuse both within and beyond research contexts.

''See also \href{http://www.science3point0.com/coaspedia/index.php/User:Daniel_Mietchen/Talks/Slides/Quotes}{Collection of "science as a wiki" quotes}.''

* Sandra Bajjalieh: "All of these issues, including the trend towards judging scientists on where they publish instead of what they publish, would be solved if NSF/NIH provided and serviced a highly searchable website onto which people posted results as they obtained them. Search engine capabilities make this entirely feasible. The following features would make the system far superior to the current one of publishing in journals. 1. The comments of interested readers would be added to the posting. Thus there would be peer review. 2. Additional data and revisions that respond to comments could be added. 3. Entry time stamps would solve any issues of priority. 4. The number of "hits" and downloads a link got (similar to the information PLoS One provides for each paper) could serve as a measure of it's interest. This solution is so obvious and the benefits so numerous (NIH program directors would have current updates of research progress, no more publication costs, the ability to imbed movies and animations....)that it's really difficult to understand why there hasn't been more of a move to implement it. Do we, as a community, really want a few people regulating the flow of scientific information?" (\href{http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110427/full/472391a.html}{Sandra Bajjalieh})

:"copyright is a regulation by the state intended to change a regulation by the market; it's an exclusive right, it's a monopoly right, a property right granted by the state which is necessary to solve an inevitable market failure." \href{http://motherboard.tv/2011/4/25/lessig-copyright-isn-t-just-hurting-creativity-it-s-killing-science-video--2}{ ... in a more colloquial nutshell by Alex Pasternack: Copyright isn't just hurting creativity: it's killing science} 
:: Notes: If we get above the din of this battle is that both sides agree that copyright is necessary for creative works - There is a place for sensible copyright policy but, however, not only artists rely upon copyright. Publishers do too rely upon copyright - the economic problem for publishers is different from that for the artists. We've been fighting a battle where copyright is essential but not on science where copyright is not essential. There is a trouble that few see - How accessible is information for the public? What does it mean for info to be available on the internet? It is only freely accessible if you are part of the 'elite'. Here copyright is placed to benefit the publishers - not the authors - no author has a business model that is built around profiting from this copyright. Does this limitation serve any of the purposes of copyright? What is the publishers objective? To disseminate knowledge or to profit from it?

*Read write creativity / read-write communities
*"Sharing is at the core of the architecture of the net"
::Note by Claudia Koltzenburg:  [by whom?] Barbara van Schewick points out: On the Internet architecture level, due to corporatism, "enclosures" are rampant. The principle of network neutrality that characterized the Internet in its beginning, thirty years ago, has been put at risk particularly by profit-making interests of network providers, observes Barabara van Schewick. The effects of this amount to what economists who think in terms of traditional market economy would call a "market failure". Van Schewick holds that we (and the regulators) need to protect the factors that allowed widespread application innovation in the past (modularity, layering and the end-to-end arguments). These factors made for the openness at the core of the Internet until the early 1990s. Van Schewick recommends let users choose, and practice as much 'application agnosticism' as possible. Internet users today are mostly controlled by flatrate offers and application bundles that leave no alternatives to choose from openly. Van Schewick's argument says that users should indeed be allowed to get a sense of how much they need for what they want to do on the internet �?? and yet maintain a predictability of one's bills. -- see Barbara van Schewick. \href{http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/chapters/0262013975intro1.pdf}{Introduction}.

*"In the academy [..] we need to recognise an ethical obligation [...] which is at the core of our mission which is universal access to knowledge." Entails: work needs to be free (this should be an ethical point) - We do not need (and should not practice) exclusivity about our work. 
*models of access that block access except to a paying elite and discourages innovation.

* Douglas Rushkoff: As soon as a network is in the hands of policy makers and their funders, this network loses its power to effect change. His conclusion is: "Create new forms that exist beyond any authority's ability to grant them protection", The Next Net. 1 March 2011. \href{http://shareable.net/blog/the-next-net}{Shareable} - Sharing by Design. 

Vannevar Bush. As we may think. \href{http://web.mit.edu/STS.035/www/PDFs/think.pdf}{The Atlantic Monthly, 1945}
*"There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers - conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, asthey appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial"
*"
Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and
by now are totally inadequate for their purpose.:

*". The summation of human experience us being expanded at a prodigious rate, and
the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the
same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships."
*"
A record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it
must be consulted"
*"Thus far we seem to be worse
off than before - for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly
consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific
research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge."

*\href{http://wikimania2011.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/Barriers_and_opportunities_for_expert_participation_in_Wikipedia:_Results_from_a_survey}{Barriers to expert participation}
**\href{http://cameronneylon.net/blog/michael-nielsen-the-credit-economy-and-open-science/}{Giving credit is key}, and if wiki contributions (or any other science 2.0 activities) would be recognized in academic career terms (\#altmetrics; requires \href{http://marciovm.com/michael-nielsen-on-the-future-of-science functional reputation systems}), scientists would be willing to reallocate their time accordingly


*'''What does "publishing" mean in a wiki context?''' The current use of the term "publishing" in itself can be taken as an illustration of how commercial codes and practices seeping into academic culture have not been counteracted successfully since the invention of the Web. In academic CVs, research output in print only (and in electronic but non-open access format) still figures as a "publication", even though the meaning of "to publish" as "make generally known" and "disseminate to the public" has seen fundamental and indeed groundbreaking changes with the Web as a publishing platform. Indeed, "the public" itself has changed fundamentally because today, a "publication" can be made accessible on the web '''without''' \href{http://scientopia.org/blogs/bookoftrogool/2010/03/15/battle-of-the-opens/ "a subscription, per-article, or other fee ... by the reader or the reader's proxy (e.g. a library)"}. Had academic institutions been more interested in the benefit offered by such opportunities, publishing openly would be much more widely accepted today. In this light, nothing should be claimed to be a "publication" any longer unless it is open, maybe even '''in the sense of Open publishing''': \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Open_publishing&id=383242580}{"Open publishing is a process of creating news or other content that is transparent to the readers. They can contribute a story and see it instantly appear in the pool of stories publicly available. Those stories are filtered as little as possible to help the readers find the stories they want. Readers can see editorial decisions being made by others. They can see how to get involved and help make editorial decisions. If they can think of a better way for the software to help shape editorial decisions, they can copy the software because it is free and change it and start their own site. If they want to redistribute the news, they can, preferably on an open publishing site."}

@superfabs, I think that the aim of the project is too wide maybe?
Fabiana Kubke 19:17 
@scann can you be more specific?
Jonas {\"O}berg 19:18 
Worthwhile to note in this discussion is that Paul Boshears has been thinking about a project to extend and make Open Journal System (OJS) more suitable for accepting non-text material. Might tie in with other open access projects.
scann 19:18 
@fabs, yes, I think maybe you need to define what are you going to consider "science", or in which areas you are going to primarily focus on to work
19:18
for example, the scientist who come from humanistic or social sciences network are more resistant to work with things like wikis
Ian Sullivan 19:20 
and the scientists from many of the hard sciences will need hosting for the large datasets that make up a lot of their source material
Fabiana Kubke 19:20 
@scann Ah, I see - I was thinking about that earlier today - how do I phrase this to say "as a first step we will do this in this area" - I thought concentrating on one specific (I was thinking Chagas would be a good candidate - I am more familiar with some implications)
