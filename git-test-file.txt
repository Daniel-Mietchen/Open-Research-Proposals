I am using this file to familiarize myself with GitHub as a collaborative drafting environment, 
as explained at 
http://www.science3point0.com/evomri/2011/05/03/drafting-proposals-in-the-open-sketching-out-project-ideas/ . 

I will start by pasting below the leftovers from the drafting of the above blog post, as per 
http://species-id.net/w/index.php?title=Draft:Encyclopaedia_of_original_research&oldid=5524 . 

We will then turn this into LaTeX format and continue drafting that way. Not yet entirely sure of the mechanics underlying that.

* Sandra Bajjalieh: "All of these issues, including the trend towards judging scientists on where they publish instead of what they publish, would be solved if NSF/NIH provided and serviced a highly searchable website onto which people posted results as they obtained them. Search engine capabilities make this entirely feasible. The following features would make the system far superior to the current one of publishing in journals. 1. The comments of interested readers would be added to the posting. Thus there would be peer review. 2. Additional data and revisions that respond to comments could be added. 3. Entry time stamps would solve any issues of priority. 4. The number of "hits" and downloads a link got (similar to the information PLoS One provides for each paper) could serve as a measure of it's interest. This solution is so obvious and the benefits so numerous (NIH program directors would have current updates of research progress, no more publication costs, the ability to imbed movies and animations....)that it's really difficult to understand why there hasn't been more of a move to implement it. Do we, as a community, really want a few people regulating the flow of scientific information?" ([http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110427/full/472391a.html Sandra Bajjalieh])

:"copyright is a regulation by the state intended to change a regulation by the market; it's an exclusive right, it's a monopoly right, a property right granted by the state which is necessary to solve an inevitable market failure."

:: Notes: If we get above the din of this battle is that both sides agree that copyright is necessary for creative works - There is a place for sensible copyright policy but, however, not only artists rely upon copyright. Publishers do too rely upon copyright - the economic problem for publishers is different from that for the artists. We've been fighting a battle where copyright is essential but not on science where copyright is not essential. There is a trouble that few see - How accessible is information for the public? What does it mean for info to be available on the internet? It is only freely accessible if you are part of the 'elite'. Here copyright is placed to benefit the publishers - not the authors - no author has a business model that is built around profiting from this copyright. Does this limitation serve any of the purposes of copyright? What is the publishers objective? To disseminate knowledge or to profit from it?

*"Sharing is at the core of the architecture of the net"
::Note by Claudia Koltzenburg:  [by whom?] Barbara van Schewick points out: On the Internet architecture level, due to corporatism, "enclosures" are rampant. The principle of network neutrality that characterized the Internet in its beginning, thirty years ago, has been put at risk particularly by profit-making interests of network providers, observes Barabara van Schewick. The effects of this amount to what economists who think in terms of traditional market economy would call a "market failure". Van Schewick holds that we (and the regulators) need to protect the factors that allowed widespread application innovation in the past (modularity, layering and the end-to-end arguments). These factors made for the openness at the core of the Internet until the early 1990s. Van Schewick recommends let users choose, and practice as much 'application agnosticism' as possible. Internet users today are mostly controlled by flatrate offers and application bundles that leave no alternatives to choose from openly. Van Schewick's argument says that users should indeed be allowed to get a sense of how much they need for what they want to do on the internet – and yet maintain a predictability of one's bills. -- see Barbara van Schewick.

*"There is a growing mountain of research. But there is increased evidence that we are being bogged down today as specialization extends. The investigator is staggered by the findings and conclusions of thousands of other workers - conclusions which he cannot find time to grasp, much less to remember, asthey appear. Yet specialization becomes increasingly necessary for progress, and the effort to bridge between disciplines is correspondingly superficial"
*"
Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and
by now are totally inadequate for their purpose.:

*". The summation of human experience us being expanded at a prodigious rate, and
the means we use for threading through the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the
same as was used in the days of square-rigged ships."
*"
A record, if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it
must be consulted"
*"Thus far we seem to be worse
off than before - for we can enormously extend the record; yet even in its present bulk we can hardly
consult it. This is a much larger matter than merely the extraction of data for the purposes of scientific
research; it involves the entire process by which man profits by his inheritance of acquired knowledge."

*'''What does "publishing" mean in a wiki context?''' The current use of the term "publishing" in itself can be taken as an illustration of how commercial codes and practices seeping into academic culture have not been counteracted successfully since the invention of the Web. In academic CVs, research output in print only (and in electronic but non-open access format) still figures as a "publication", even though the meaning of "to publish" as "make generally known" and "disseminate to the public" has seen fundamental and indeed groundbreaking changes with the Web as a publishing platform. Indeed, "the public" itself has changed fundamentally because today, a "publication" can be made accessible on the web '''without''' [http://scientopia.org/blogs/bookoftrogool/2010/03/15/battle-of-the-opens/ "a subscription, per-article, or other fee ... by the reader or the reader's proxy (e.g. a library)"]. Had academic institutions been more interested in the benefit offered by such opportunities, publishing openly would be much more widely accepted today. In this light, nothing should be claimed to be a "publication" any longer unless it is open, maybe even '''in the sense of Open publishing''': [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Cite&page=Open_publishing&id=383242580 "Open publishing is a process of creating news or other content that is transparent to the readers. They can contribute a story and see it instantly appear in the pool of stories publicly available. Those stories are filtered as little as possible to help the readers find the stories they want. Readers can see editorial decisions being made by others. They can see how to get involved and help make editorial decisions. If they can think of a better way for the software to help shape editorial decisions, they can copy the software because it is free and change it and start their own site. If they want to redistribute the news, they can, preferably on an open publishing site."]

@superfabs, I think that the aim of the project is too wide maybe?
Fabiana Kubke 19:17 
@scann can you be more specific?
Jonas Öberg 19:18 
Worthwhile to note in this discussion is that Paul Boshears has been thinking about a project to extend and make Open Journal System (OJS) more suitable for accepting non-text material. Might tie in with other open access projects.
scann 19:18 
@fabs, yes, I think maybe you need to define what are you going to consider "science", or in which areas you are going to primarily focus on to work
19:18
for example, the scientist who come from humanistic or social sciences network are more resistant to work with things like wikis
Ian Sullivan 19:20 
and the scientists from many of the hard sciences will need hosting for the large datasets that make up a lot of their source material
Fabiana Kubke 19:20 
@scann Ah, I see - I was thinking about that earlier today - how do I phrase this to say "as a first step we will do this in this area" - I thought concentrating on one specific (I was thinking Chagas would be a good candidate - I am more familiar with some implications)
